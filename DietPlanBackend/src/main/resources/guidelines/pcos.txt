PCOS dietary management benefits from steady blood sugar control, balanced carbohydrates, and high fiber meals. Whole grains, vegetables, pulses, and quality proteins are strongly recommended.

Avoid frequent spikes in blood sugar. Encourage pairing carbohydrates with protein or fats. For example: roti + vegetables + paneer/tofu/curd instead of roti alone.

Choose low glycemic index whole grains like millets, brown rice, whole wheat, quinoa, rolled oats, or barley. Avoid relying heavily on refined flour foods, deep-fried snacks, and sugary desserts.

Encourage daily movement such as brisk walking, yoga, and strength training. Muscle building supports hormone regulation and improves insulin sensitivity.

Limit intake of sugar, sweet drinks, and overeating of fruit juices and sweets. Whole fruits with fiber are preferable to juices.

Healthy fat sources such as nuts, seeds, and olive oil can support hormone balance. Advise moderation instead of restriction.
