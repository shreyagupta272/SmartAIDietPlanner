Always prioritize whole foods over packaged or ultra-processed foods. Fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins, and nuts should make up the majority of daily intake.

Aim for balanced plates consisting of:
- One serving of protein (palm-sized or 1 cup cooked lentils/beans)
- One serving of carbs (1 cup cooked grains or 2 medium rotis)
- Two fist-sized servings of vegetables or salad

Hydration matters more than supplements. Encourage clients to drink 2–3 liters of water per day. Herbal teas and lemon water are good options if a client dislikes plain water.

Avoid recommending drastic calorie cuts, detox diets, or complete elimination of food groups. Sustainable lifestyle change always beats “quick weight loss” approaches.

Sleep duration affects hunger hormones. Encourage 7–8 hours of regular sleep for better fat loss, recovery, and mood stability.

Encourage consistency over perfection. Small positive habits every day are more impactful than aggressive short-term diets.
