For muscle gain, emphasize calorie surplus with high-quality protein, optimal carbs, and strength training. Protein requirements generally increase for active individuals.

Protein sources include eggs, paneer, tofu, lentils, chickpeas, lean meats, milk, Greek yogurt, beans, and whey protein if needed. A protein source is ideal at every meal.

Carbohydrates fuel workouts and recovery. Recommend whole grains, potatoes, sweet potato, oats, rice, millets, and bananas. Post-workout meals should include a mix of carbs + protein.

Healthy fats help meet calorie targets without overeating volume. Recommend nuts, seeds, peanut butter, avocado, ghee, olive oil, or coconut oil.

Encourage progressive overload resistance training at least 3–4 times per week. Walking and daily activity remain beneficial but should not replace structured strength work.

Avoid ultra-low-calorie eating when trying to build muscle. Under-eating slows recovery, reduces strength gains, and can increase fatigue.
