For fat loss, focus on high-protein meals and fiber-rich foods that improve satiety. Protein options include paneer, tofu, lentils, beans, eggs, curd, Greek yogurt, and lean meats.

Use portion control instead of extreme calorie restriction. Examples:
- 1 cup cooked grains like rice, millets, or oats
- 2 medium rotis
- 1 small fruit instead of fruit juices
- A palm-sized serving of protein with each meal
- A fist-sized portion of vegetables at lunch and dinner

Prioritize foods that keep hunger low: lentils, vegetables, salads, eggs, tofu, nuts, seeds, high-protein yogurt, and whole grains. Avoid frequent snacking on packaged foods.

Avoid liquid calories such as soft drinks, sweetened teas and coffees, and “healthy” sugar drinks like fruit juices. Replace with herbal tea, lemon water, buttermilk, or infused water.

Encourage NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis): simple walking, household movement, standing breaks from desk work. Even 7–10k steps per day improves fat loss outcomes.

Avoid recommending crash diets, long term fasting, or extremely low carb meals for most clients unless medically supervised.
